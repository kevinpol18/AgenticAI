    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "The trip to AgentsVille features two travelers, Yuri and Hiro, both in their mid to late twenties and early thirties. Yuri has a passion for tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, while Hiro enjoys reading, music, theatre, and art. Their visit spans from June 10th to June 12th, 2025, with a total budget of 130, and the planned itinerary comes in under budget at a total cost of 105. The activities selected thoughtfully reflect their interests and account for varying weather conditions, including indoor options for comfort and social engagement.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10th, the arrival day, the weather is expected to be clear and warm. The day starts with the FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up, a gathering centered on technology trends, gadget demonstrations, and networking—ideal for Yuri’s keen interest in technology and perfect for an indoor morning event. Following this, the Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon provides a unique blend of tennis and cooking, offering both an active and culinary experience that caters specifically to Yuri’s passions. This social and lively outdoor activity also serves as a filling and enjoyable lunch on their first day.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 11th, the weather is partly cloudy with warm temperatures. The morning kicks off with the Morning Groove Dance Party, an energetic indoor dance session that taps into Hiro’s love of music as well as general fitness and social interaction. Midday features the Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers, an engaging event focused on artificial intelligence, combining technology and elements of music technology, providing a stimulating experience for both Yuri and Hiro. Being indoors, this option ensures comfort despite the weather and encourages networking with like-minded enthusiasts.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the final day, June 12th, thunderstorms are forecasted, so the activities are thoughtfully planned with indoor alternatives. Around noon, the Soundtrack Picnic offers an engaging program blending movies and live music with the potential for an indoor setting if the weather is unfavorable, catering to Hiro’s interests in music and movies, while also being enjoyable for Yuri. To close the trip, the Tech & Film Fusion Night presents an immersive evening combining cutting-edge technology and cinema in a virtual reality theater. This event perfectly bridges the travelers’ interests in technology and movies and provides a memorable and interactive finale to their visit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the itinerary balances both travelers’ diverse interests while adapting to the environment, ensuring engaging and comfortable experiences throughout the trip."
